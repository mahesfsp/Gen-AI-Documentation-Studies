# Computer Vision: Overview, How it Works, Applications, and Use Cases

## üß† What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to extract meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs‚Äîand take actions or make recommendations based on that information.

It allows machines to **see**, **interpret**, and **understand** the visual world just like humans.

### Everyday Examples:

- **Barcode Scanners** ‚Äì Decoding product information
- **Camera Auto-Focus** ‚Äì Adjusting lens based on image depth
- **MRI Scans** ‚Äì Analyzing medical imagery
- **Traffic Inspection** ‚Äì Detecting violations via cameras

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Does Computer Vision Work?

### 1. **Classical Approach**

- Involves manual feature extraction: shapes, edges, patterns.
- Algorithms such as SIFT, SURF, and HOG are used.
- Ideal for well-defined tasks with clear visual rules.

### 2. **Deep Learning Approach**

- Utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to automatically learn features from images.
- Requires a **large dataset** of labeled images for training.
- More accurate and scalable than classical methods.

### üîÑ Process Flow:

1. Input raw image/video
2. Preprocess (resize, normalize)
3. Feed into model (CNN, RNN, etc.)
4. Model outputs predictions (class, bounding box, mask)
5. Action based on prediction

## üçÖ Tomato Sorting Example

To build a system that sorts tomatoes based on ripeness:

- **Input:** Thousands of images of good and bad tomatoes
- **Training:** Neural network learns patterns (color, shape, size)
- **Decision:** The model can now classify and sort new tomatoes
- **Benefits:** Reduces manual effort, improves speed, minimizes error, and ensures consistency
