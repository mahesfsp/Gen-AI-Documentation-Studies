# BOVEM: Understanding LLMs and Their Use Cases

## üß† What is an LLM (Large Language Model)?

- A type of AI model developed to **process and understand human language**.
- Uses **deep learning algorithms**, primarily **Transformer architecture**, to analyze patterns in massive datasets.
- Capable of generating, summarizing, translating, and understanding text.

## üîÅ How LLMs Work

### 1. **Pre-training**

- LLMs are trained on **billions of text samples** from books, websites, articles, etc.
- Purpose: To learn **language structure**, **contextual relationships**, and **semantic meaning**.
- Example: ChatGPT trained on large-scale internet datasets.

### 2. **Fine-tuning**

- Model is further trained on **task-specific datasets** (e.g., legal text, customer chats).
- Helps adapt the general model to **specific use-cases**.

## üîí Secret Behind LLM Power: Transformer Architecture

- The **Transformer** is the key architecture enabling LLMs.
- Uses **self-attention** mechanism to understand context and relationships across long sequences of text.
