# Robotic Process Automation (RPA): Automating the Digital Workforce

## 🤖 What is RPA?

**Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** is a technology that allows businesses to automate repetitive, rule-based digital tasks. Software “robots” mimic human interactions with digital systems to execute business processes faster, more accurately, and 24/7.

RPA helps companies improve productivity, reduce errors, and free up employees to focus on higher-value work.

## 🧩 Key Features of RPA

- **No-code/Low-code** – Easily configurable by business users
- **Non-intrusive** – Works on top of existing systems without modification
- **Rule-based Execution** – Best for predictable, repetitive tasks
- **Auditability** – Actions performed by bots are logged and traceable
- **Scalability** – Can be scaled across departments and workloads

## 🧠 How RPA Works

1. **Bot Development** – Define steps of a task (e.g., open app, copy data, paste to another system)
2. **Bot Deployment** – Schedule or trigger bots on demand or via events
3. **Monitoring & Logging** – Track performance, errors, and audit trails
